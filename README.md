This my movie recommendation system which i have created using Python, API integration, NLP,content based filtering algorithms and created similarity scores and interactive Streamlit web app for real_time recommendations.
# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

A Pythonâ€‘based movie recommendation engine that suggests films similar to a userâ€‘selected title using content-based filtering techniques.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Quickly recommends movies based on similarity  
- Scalable and easy to extend to other recommendation methodologies  
- Clean, modular Python codebase  

## Technologies

- Python 3.x  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikitâ€‘learn (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)  
- Streamlit (optional for GUI)

## Project Structure
movie_recommendation/ â”œâ”€â”€ movie_recommendor.py 
Core recommendation engine â”œâ”€â”€ movies.csv  # Dataset of movies (title, plot, genres)
requirements.txt  
README.md  

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ojas45shinde/movie_recommendation.git
   cd movie_recommendation
2. **Install dependencies**

     pip install -r requirements.txt



## How It Works

**1. Preprocessing:**

Load movies.csv including plot descriptions.
Clean and vectorize text using TFâ€‘IDF.

**2. Similarity Calculation:**

Compute cosine similarity matrix across all movie plot features.

**3. Recommendation Logic:**

Given an input title, fetch its vector.
Sort other titles by descending similarity (excluding the input).
Return the top N recommendations.
